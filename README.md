# HTML-quiz
Test your knowledge in HTML

# Front end 
Landing page with the title and the button to take the user to the quiz. 

- Page starts with 6 questions and 3 possible multiple choice answers 
- after you you have answered all the questions you will know the amount you answered correctly compared to the amount of questions there are. 
- I have also implemented the color coding to let the user know which questions were answered wrong and which ones were answered right. (green for right, red for wrong)
- At the end of the quiz alert box will display showing the percentage the user got as well as the fail/pass percentage and will be shown the message saying whether the user passed or failed.
